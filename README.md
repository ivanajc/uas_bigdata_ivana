For this final exam assignment, I have attached two Python notebook files. 
1. The file 'uas_klbd_paper2023.ipynb' contains code aimed at reproducing the results obtained in the paper titled 'BTR: A Bioinformatics Tool Recommendation System.' This file is created to fulfill the task of replicating the paper. 
2. The second file, 'uas_klbd_tutorial_ivana.ipynb,' is intended for reproducing collaborative filtering-related code in the field of bioinformatics that I found on GitHub. This file is designed to fulfill the task of creating a tutorial.
